# Outline

That was the last chapter of the book. If you liked it, share the book as a way to learn React to your friends. In addition, you could give the book a review on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33541539-the-road-to-learn-react) to support it.

I am writing already the next book about state management in React. It focuses mainly on Redux and all the best practices around it. But it will also teach local state management, show alternatives in state management with MobX and outline technologies like Relay/GraphQL. [You can already pre-order it](https://gumroad.com/products/uwiyI) and support me.

**But where can you go from here?** You can either extend the application on your own or dive into your own React project. Before you dive into another book or tutorial, you should create your own hands-on React project. Do it for one week, release it somewhere and reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch). I am curious what you will build after you have read the book. You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/rwieruch) to share your repository.

If you are looking for further extensions for your application, I can recommend several learning paths:

* **Code Organization:** On your way reading the book you came across one chapter about Code Organization. You could apply these changes now, if you haven't done it yet. It will organize your components in structured files and folders (modules). In addition, it helps to understand and learn the principles of code splitting, reusability, maintainability and module API design.

* **Asynchronous Requests:** You can substitute the native fetch API with third party alternatives to perform asynchronous requests: [superagent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent) or [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios). There is no perfect solution to make asynchronous requests. But by exchanging the buildings blocks around React, you make the experience [how powerful it can be to have this flexibility](https://www.robinwieruch.de/reasons-why-i-moved-from-angular-to-react/). In frameworks you usually stick to one solution. In a flexible ecosystem like React you can exchange the solutions.

* **Type Checking:** In one chapter you have used React PropTypes to define component interfaces. It is a good practice to prevent bugs. But the PropTypes are only checked on runtime. You can go one step further to introduce static type checking on compile time. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is one popular approach. But in the React ecosystem people often use [Flow](https://flowtype.org/). I can recommend to give Flow a shot.

* **Tooling with Webpack and Babel:** In the book you used *create-react-app* to set up your application. At some point, when you learned React, you want to learn the tooling around it. It enables you to setup your own project without *create-react-app*. I can recommend to follow a minimal setup with [Webpack and Babel](https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/). Afterward you could [use ESLint](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-eslint-webpack-babel/) to follow a unified code style in your application.

* **State Management:** You have used React `this.setState()` to manage internal component state. That's a perfect start. However, in a scaling application you will experience the limits of internal component state. Therefore you have third party state management libraries like [Redux or MobX](https://www.robinwieruch.de/redux-mobx-confusion/). My [next book](https://gumroad.com/products/uwiyI) will give you guidance on this topic.

* **Routing:** You can implement routing for your application with [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router). So far you only have one page in your application. React Router helps you to have multiple pages across multiple URLs.

In general, I invite you to [visit my website](https://www.robinwieruch.de/) to find more interesting topics about web development. You can [subscribe](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/rwieruch) to get updates every 3 months to your inbox.

Once again, if you liked the book, I want you to take a moment to think about a person who would be a good match to learn React. Reach out to that person and share the book. It would mean a lot to me. The book is intended to be given to others. The book will improve when more people consume it and share their feedback.

Thank you a lot for reading the Road to learn React.

Stay tuned for the [next one](https://gumroad.com/products/uwiyI).
