# Outline

That was the last chapter of the book. I hope you enjoyed reading it and that it helped you to get traction in React. If you liked the book, share it as a way to learn React with your friends. It should be used as giveaway. In addition, it would mean a lot to me if you could take 5 minutes to write a review about it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077HJFCQX) or [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37503118-the-road-to-learn-react).

**So, where can you go from here after reading this book?** You can either extend the application on your own or give your own React project a shot. Before you dive into another book, course or tutorial, you should create your own hands-on React project. Do it for one week, take it to production by deploying it somewhere, and reach out to me [me](https://twitter.com/rwieruch) or others to showcase it. I am curious what you will build after you have read the book.

If you are looking for further extensions for your application, I can recommend several learning paths after you have used only plain React in this book:

* **State Management:** You have used React `this.setState()` and `this.state` to manage and access local component state. That's a perfect start. However, in a larger application you will experience the [limits of React's local component state](https://www.robinwieruch.de/learn-react-before-using-redux/). Therefore you can use a third-party state management library such as [Redux or MobX](https://www.robinwieruch.de/redux-mobx-confusion/). On the course platform [Road to React](https://roadtoreact.com/), you will find the course "Taming the State in React" that teaches advanced local state in React, Redux and MobX. The course comes with an ebook as well, but I recommend everyone to dive into the source code and screencasts too. If you liked this book, you should definitely checkout Taming the State in React.

* **Connecting to a Database and/or Authentication:** In a growing React application, you may want to persist data eventually. The data should be stored in a database so that it can survive after a browser session and be shared across different users using your application. The simplest way to introduce a database is using Firebase. In [this comprehensive tutorial](https://www.robinwieruch.de/complete-firebase-authentication-react-tutorial/), you will find a step by step guide on how to use Firebase authentication (sign up, sign in, sign out, ...) in React. Beyond that, you will use Firebase's realtime database to store user entities. After that, it's up to you to store more data in the database which is needed by your application.

* **Tooling with Webpack and Babel:** In the book you have used *create-react-app* to set up your application. At some point, when you have learned React, you might want to learn the tooling around it. It enables you to setup your own project without *create-react-app*. I can recommend to follow a minimal setup with [Webpack and Babel](https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/). Afterward, you can apply more tooling on your own. For instance, you could [use ESLint](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-eslint-webpack-babel/) to follow a unified code style in your application.

* **React Component Syntax:** The possibilities and best practices to implement React components evolve over time. You will find many ways to write your React components, especially React class components, in other learning resources. You can checkout [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/the-road-to-learn-react/react-alternative-class-component-syntax) to find out about an alternative way to write React class components. By using the class field declarations, you can write them even more concise in the future.

* **Other Projects:** After learning plain React, it is always good to apply the learnings first in your own projects before learning something new. You could write your own tic-tac-toe game or a simple calculator in React. There are plenty of tutorials out there that use only React to build something exciting. Check out mine about building [a paginated and infinite scrolling list](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-paginated-list/), [showcasing tweets on a Twitter wall](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-svg-patterns/) or [connecting your React application to Stripe for charging money](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-express-stripe-payment/). Experiment with these mini applications to get comfortable in React.

* **UI Components:** You shouldn't make the mistake to introduce too early a UI component library in your project. First, you should learn how to implement and use a dropdown, checkbox or dialog in React with standard HTML elements from scratch. The major part of these components will manage their own local state. A checkbox has to know whether it is checked or not checked. Thus you should implement them as controlled components. After you went through all the foundational implementations, you can introduce a UI component library which gives you checkboxes and dialogs as React components.

* **Code Organization:** On your way reading the book, you came across one chapter about code organization. You could apply these changes now, if you haven't done it yet. It will organize your components in structured files and folders (modules). In addition, it helps you to understand and learn the principles of code splitting, reusability, maintainability and module API design. Eventually your application will grow in size and you will need to structure it in modules. So it's better you get started now.

* **Testing:** The book only scratched the surface of testing. If you are not familiar with the general topic, you could dive deeper into the concepts of unit testing and integration testing, especially in context of React applications. On an implementation level, I would recommend to stick to Enzyme and Jest in order to refine your approach of testing with unit tests and snapshot tests in React.

* **Routing:** You can implement routing for your application with [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router). So far, you only have one page in your application. React Router helps you to have multiple pages across multiple URLs. When you introduce routing to your application, you don't make any requests to your web server to request the next page. The router will do everything for you on the client-side. So get your hands dirty and introduce routing in your application.

* **Type Checking:** In one chapter, you have used React PropTypes to define component interfaces. It is a general good practice to prevent bugs. But the PropTypes are only checked on runtime. You can go one step further to introduce static type checking on compile time. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is one popular approach. But in the React ecosystem, people often use [Flow](https://flowtype.org/). I can recommend to give Flow a shot, if you are interested to make your application more robust.

* **React Native:** [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) brings your application on mobile devices. You can apply your learnings from React to ship iOS and Android applications. The learning curve, once you have learned React, shouldn't be steep in React Native. Both share the same principles. You will only encounter different layout components on mobile than you are used to in web applications.

In general, I invite you to visit my [website](https://www.robinwieruch.de) to find more interesting topics about web development and software engineering. You can [subscribe to my Newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/rwieruch) to get updates about articles, books, and courses. Furthermore, the course platform [Road to React](https://roadtoreact.com) offers more advanced courses to learn about the React ecosystem. You should check it out!

Last but not least, I hope to find more [Patrons](https://www.patreon.com/rwieruch) who are able to support my content. There are many students out there who cannot afford to pay for educational content. That's why I put lots of my content out there for free. By supporting me in my doings as being my Patron, I can sustain these efforts to educate others for free.

Once again, if you liked the book, I want you to take a moment to think about a person who would be a good match to learn React. Reach out to that person and share the book. It would mean a lot to me. The book is intended to be given to others. It will improve over time when more people read it and share their feedback with me. I hope to see your feedback, review or rating as well!

Thank you a lot for reading the Road to learn React.
