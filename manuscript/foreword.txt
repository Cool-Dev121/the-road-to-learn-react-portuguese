# Foreword

I love to teach, even though I am no expert. I learn every day and I have the fortune to have great mentors. After all not everyone has the opportunity to learn from mentors and peers. The book is my attempt to give something back which might help people to get started and advance in React.

**But why me?** In the past I have written a large tutorial to implement a [SoundCloud Client in React + Redux](http://www.robinwieruch.de/the-soundcloud-client-in-react-redux). I never expected the overwhelming reaction. I learned a lot during the process of writing. But even more by getting your feedback. It was my first attempt to teach people in programming.

It also taught me to do better. I realized the SoundCloud tutorial is suited for advanced developers. It uses several tools to bootstrap your application and dives quickly into Redux. Still it helped a lot of people to get started. In my opinion it is a great tutorial to get a bigger picture of React + Redux. I use every free minute to improve the material, but it is time consuming.

In the Road to learn React I want to offer a foundation before you start to dive into the broader React ecosystem. It has less tooling and less external state management, but more React. It explains general concepts, patterns and best practices. You will learn to build your own Hacker News application. It cover real world features like pagination, client-side caching and interactions. Additionally you will transition from JavaScript ES5 to JavaScript ES6. After all the book should give you a solid foundation in React before you dive into more advanced topics like Redux.

# FAQ

**How do I get updates?** You can [subscribe](http://eepurl.com/caLPjr) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch) to get updates. It keeps me motivated to do my work. Once you have a copy of the book, it will stay updated. But you have to download the copy again once its updated. I will notify everyone via the [Newsletter](http://eepurl.com/caLPjr) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch).

**Does it cover Redux?** It doesn't. The book should give you a solid foundation before you dive into advanced topics like Redux. Still the implementation in the book will show you that you don't need Redux to build an application.

**Can I help to improve it?** Yes! You can have a direct impact with your thoughts and [contribution on GitHub](https://github.com/rwieruch/the-road-to-learn-react). I don't claim to be an expert nor to write in native english. I would appreciate your help very much.

**What are the reading formats?** In addition to the .pdf, .epub, and .mobi formats, you can read it in pure markdown on [GitHub](https://github.com/rwieruch/the-road-to-learn-react). In general, I recommend reading it on a larger format, otherwise the code snippets will have ugly line breaks.

**Will you add more chapters in the future?** See the Changelog chapter for updates that already happened. In general it depends on the community. If there is an acceptance for the book, I will deliver more chapters and improve old material. I will keep the content up to date with recent best practices, concepts and patterns. But it has to pay me a bit of my effort. I would love to hear your thoughts about possible chapters to improve and enrich the learning experience.

# How to read it?

Are you new to React? That's perfect. I will need your feedback to improve the material to enable everyone to learn React. You can have a direct impact on [GitHub](https://github.com/rwieruch/the-road-to-learn-react) or give me feedback on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch).

In general each chapter will build up on the previous. Each of them will dive into a new learning. Don't rush through the book. You should internalize each step. You could apply your own implementations and read more about the topic. Make yourself comfortable with the learnings before you continue.

After you have read the book you could dive into the [SoundCloud Client in React + Redux](http://www.robinwieruch.de/the-soundcloud-client-in-react-redux). It guides you to implement your own SoundCloud application with a state management library.
