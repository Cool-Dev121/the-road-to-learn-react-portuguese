# Foreword

I love to teach, even though I am no expert. I learn every day and I have the fortune to have great mentors. After all not everyone has the opportunity to learn from mentors and peers. The book is my attempt to give something back which might help people to get started and advance in React.

**But why me?** In the past I have written a larger tutorial to implement a [SoundCloud Client in React + Redux](http://www.robinwieruch.de/the-soundcloud-client-in-react-redux). I never expected the overwhelming reaction. I learned a lot during the process of writing. But even more by getting your honest feedback. It was my first attempt to teach people in programming.

It also taught me to do better. I realized the SoundCloud tutorial is suited for advanced developers. It uses several tools to bootstrap your application and dives pretty quickly into Redux. Still it helped a lot of people to get started. In my opinion it's a great tutorial to get a bigger picture of React + Redux. I use every free minute to improve the material, but it's time consuming. I am going to overhaul it as a whole in the future.

In the Road to learn React I want to offer a foundation before you start to dive into the more advanced React ecosystem. It has less tooling and less external state management, but more React. It explains general concepts and patterns. Additionally it links to the official documentation, because it's a great reference to learn React. After all I want to give a clear road to learn the React ecosystem. It should provide you a solid foundation before you dive into more advanced topics like Redux.

# FAQ

**How do I get updates?** You can [subscribe](http://eepurl.com/caLPjr) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch). It will keep me motivated to work on the book as well. Once you have a copy of the book, it will stay updated. But you have to download the copy again once its updated.

**Does it cover Redux?** It doesn't. The book should give you a solid foundation before you dive into advanced topics like Redux. Still the implementation in the book will show you that you don't need Redux to build a presentable application.

**Can I help to improve it?** Yes! You can have a direct impact with your thoughts and [contribution on GitHub](https://github.com/rwieruch/the-road-to-learn-react). I don't claim to be an expert nor to write in native english. I would appreciate your help very much.

**What are the reading formats?** In addition to the .pdf, .epub, and .mobi formats, you can read it in pure markdown on [GitHub](https://github.com/rwieruch/the-road-to-learn-react). In general, I recommend reading it on a larger format, otherwise the code snippets will have ugly line breaks.

**Will you add more chapters in the future?** It depends on the community. If there is an acceptance for the book, I will deliver more chapters. Additionally I would love to hear your thoughts about possible chapters to improve and enrich the learning experience.

**Have there been updates of the book already?**

# How to read it?

Are you new to React? That's perfect. I will need your feedback to improve the material to enable everyone to learn React. You can have a direct impact on [GitHub](https://github.com/rwieruch/the-road-to-learn-react) or give me feedback on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch).

In general each chapter will build up on the previous. Each of them will dive into a new learning. Don't rush through the book. You should internalize each step. You could apply your own implementations and read more about the topic. Make yourself comfortable with the learnings before you continue.

After you have read the book you could dive into the [SoundCloud Client in React + Redux](http://www.robinwieruch.de/the-soundcloud-client-in-react-redux). It guides you to implement your own SoundCloud application with a state management library.
