# Final Steps to Production

The last chapters will show you how to deploy your application to production.
You will use the free hosting service Heroku.
On the way to deploy your application you will learn more about *create-react-app*.

## Eject

The following step and knowledge is **not necessary** to deploy your application to production. Still, I want to explain it to you. *create-react-app* comes with one feature to prevent vendor lock-in. A vendor lock-in usually happens when you buy into a technology but there is no escape hatch. In a vendor lock-in it is hard to change the technology. In *create-react-app* you have the escape hatch with "eject".

In your *package.json* you will find the scripts to *start*, *test* and *build* your application. The last script is *eject*. You could try it, but there is no way back. **It is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you canâ€™t go back!**. If you just started to learn React, it makes no sense to leave the convenient environment of *create-react-app*.

If you would run `npm run eject`, the command would copy all the configuration and dependencies to your *package.json* and a new *config/* folder. You would convert the whole project into a custom setup with tooling that includes Babel, Webpack and ESLint. After all, you would have full control over all these tools.

The official documentation says that *create-react-app* is suitable for small to mid size projects. You shouldn't feel obligated to use the "eject" command.

## Deploy your App

In the end no application should stay on localhost. You want to go live. Heroku is a platform as a service where you can host your application. They offer a seamless integration with React. To be more specific: It's possible to deploy a create-react-app in minutes. It is a zero-configuration deployment which follows the philosophy of create-react-app.

You need to fulfill two requirements before you can deploy your application to Heroku:

* install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line)
* create a [free Heroku account](https://www.heroku.com/)

If you have installed Homebrew, you can install the Heroku CLI from command line:

{title="Command Line",lang="text"}
~~~~~~~~
brew update
brew install heroku-toolbelt
~~~~~~~~

Now you can use git and Heroku CLI to deploy your application.

{title="Command Line",lang="text"}
~~~~~~~~
git init
heroku create -b https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack.git
git add .
git commit -m "react-create-app on Heroku"
git push heroku master
heroku open
~~~~~~~~

That's it. I hope your application is up and running now. If you run into problems you can check the following resources:
