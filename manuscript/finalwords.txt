# Final Words

That was the last chapter of the book. I hope you liked it so far. Share it with your friends, it would mean a lot to me.

**But where can you go from here?** You can either extend the application on your own or dive into your own React project. Before you dive into another book or tutorial, you should create your own hands-on React project. Do it for one week, release it somewhere and reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch). I am curious what you will build after you have read the book. You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/rwieruch) to share your repository.

If you are looking for further extensions for your app, I can recommend two paths:

* implement routing for your App with react-router
* use a state management library (Redux or MobX) for scaling state management

After you have built your own React application, you may want to experiment with Redux. Redux is a state management library. You can build your own [SoundCloud Client in React + Redux](https://www.robinwieruch.de/the-soundcloud-client-in-react-redux) in a tutorial. The tutorial shows you more advanced tooling around React. It has multiple [extensions to cover topics like ESLint, Flow, Normalizr, MobX and Observables](https://github.com/rwieruch/react-redux-soundcloud).
