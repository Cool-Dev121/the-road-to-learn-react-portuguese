# Final Words

That was the last chapter of the book. I hope you liked it so far. Share it with your friends, it would mean a lot to me.

**But where can you go from here?** You can either extend the application on your own or dive into your own React project. Before you dive into another book or tutorial, you should create your own hands-on React project. Do it for one week, release it somewhere and reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch). I am curious what you will build after you have read the book. You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/rwieruch) to share your repository.

If you are looking for further extensions for your app, I can recommend two paths:

* [react router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-tutorial) to manage multiple pages
* state management with [Redux (or MobX)](https://www.robinwieruch.de/redux-mobx-confusion/)

After you have built your own React application, you may want to experiment with Redux. Redux is a state management library. You can build your own [SoundCloud Client in React + Redux](https://www.robinwieruch.de/the-soundcloud-client-in-react-redux). The tutorial can be found on my website.

Additionally you can check out my [Tips to learn React + Redux](https://www.robinwieruch.de/tips-to-learn-react-redux/).

In general I invite you to visit my website [www.robinwieruch.de](https://www.robinwieruch.de/) to find more interesting topics to learn about React. [Subscribe](http://eepurl.com/caLPjr) to my Newsletter to get updates for my content.

If you liked the book, I hope you will share it with your friends. I would really appreciate it. Thanks for reading - Robin.
